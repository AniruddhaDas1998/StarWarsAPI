The html file contains d3 code that renders the visualisation of the information
received. The d3 code creates multiple blue circles each representing a species.
The red circles all represent characters. The characters migrate towards the species
 that they belong to. Hovering the mouse over any of the characters or species gives
 additional information about the species or the charater.
The characters can also be dragged to declutter, but the species remain fixed.
