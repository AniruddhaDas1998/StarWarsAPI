The html file contains d3 code that renders the visualisation of the information
received. The d3 code creates multiple blue circles each representing a planet.
The red circles all represent characters. The characters migrate towards the planet
 that they are from. Hovering the mouse over any of the characters or planets gives
 additional information about the planet or the charater.
The characters can also be dragged to declutter, but the planets remain fixed.
